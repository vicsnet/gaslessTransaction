**ilk** - collateral type; each has its own set of risk parameters
<br/>
**urn** - vault; an ethereum address can control one urn per collateral type
<br/>
**gem** - unlocked collateral; gem is collateral that is not yet locked in a Vault but still recorded in the system
<br/>
**sin** - system debt unit; a debt balance that is tracked during liquidation process
<br/>
**dai** - stablecoin; a good debt token
<br/>
**Vat** - The single source of truth for the Maker Protocol. It contains the accounting system of
the core Vault, Internal Dai balances, and collateral state. The Vat has no external dependencies and maintains the central "Accounting Invariants" of the Maker Protocol. It houses the public interface for Vault management, allowing urn (Vault) owners to adjust their Vault state balances. It also contains the public interface for Vault fungibility, allowing urn (Vault) owners to transfer,
split, and merge Vaults. Excluding these interfaces, the Vat is accessed through trusted smartcontract modules.
<br/>
**Cat** - Public interface for confiscating unsafe urns (Vaults) and processing seized collateral
via their respective flip (collateral) auction. With large Vaults, partial confiscations of a fixed
collateral size will be processed until the urn becomes safe again.
<br/>
**Spotter** - Allows external actors to update the price feed in Vat for a given Ilk (collateral type).
<br/>
**Join** - The Join adapter is used to deposit/withdraw unlocked collateral into the Vat.
Currently, GemJoin is only compatible with standard ERC20 tokens, but eventually there will be various types of Join adapters that are compatible with different Token Standards.
<br/>
**Flipper** - Collateral auction house. Each gem auction is unique and linked to a previously bitten urn (Vault). Investors bid with increasing amounts of DAI for a fixed GEM amount. When the DAI balance deficit is covered, bidders continue to bid for a
decreasing gem size until the auction is complete. Remaining GEM is returned to the Vault owner.
<br/>
**DS-Token** - An implementation supporting the ERC20 Standard; part of the DappSys (DS) library.
Contains database of MKR owners, transfer and supply logic.
<br/>
**Vow** - The Vow represents the Maker Protocol’s balance, as the recipient of both system surplus and system debt. Its function is to cover deficits via debt auctions and discharge surpluses via surplus auctions.
<br/>
**Flopper** - Debt Auction house. Debt auctions are used to satisfy the Vow’s debt by auctioning off MKR for a fixed amount of internal Dai. Bidders compete with decreasing “amount requests” of MKR. After auction settlement, the Flopper sends the received internal Dai to the Vow to cancel out its debt. The Flopper mints the MKR for the winning bidder.
<br/>
**Flapper** - Surplus Auction house. Surplus auctions are used to liquidate the Vow’s surplus by auctioning off a fixed size of internal Dai for MKR. Bidders compete with increasing amounts
of MKR. After auction settlement, the Flapper burns the winning MKR bid and sends the internal Dai to the winning bidder.
<br/>
**Jug** - Contains drip(), a public function used to update an Ilk debt rate for an assigned stability fee. Since a debt rate is a function of time, it should be updated via drip() on a regular basis. Auction keepers, MKR holders, and other relevant stakeholders are incentivized to call Jug.drip().
<br/>
**Pot** - The Pot contract is where a Dai holder would lock up Internal Dai to accrue earned dai at the Dai Savings Rate. Similar to Jug, this contract employs its own Drip function used to update it’s own internal rate.This rate follows the Dai Savings Rate and is used in the exchange of a claim to the Pot’s Pie and Internal Dai. Dai holders, MKR holders, and other relevant stakeholders are incentivized to call Pot.drip(). A portion of the Stability Fee dividends is allocated for the Dai Savings Rate by increasing the amount of Sin in the Vow at eve_getWipeAllWadency Shutdown. It supports various scenarios, ranging from over-collateralization among all ilks to global under-
collateralization, which is when the net value of all collateral types is less than the total Dai supply. In the latter edge cases, where the collateral base is limited, the Vault owner payout (in the form of excess
collateral) is prioritized over the claims of Dai holders.
<br/>
**ESM** - The Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM) is a contract with the ability to call End.cage() and initiate ES. MKR holders join their funds, which are then immediately burnt. When the ESM's internal sum balance is equal to or greater than the minimum threshold, then End.cage() can be called.
<br/>
**RO (Rates Oracle)** - Through admin access to the Rates Module, the Rates Oracle enables more dynamic updates to the Risk Premium Rates, Base Rate and Savings Rate. As a secondary governance mechanism, the Rates Oracle allows MKR holders to vote with the IOUs they receive when locking up their MKR in DS-Chief. Furthermore, to vote they have to stake some amount of Dai (e.g. $1000 or $10,000), which will be passed on to the Buffer if they vote for a losing proposal.
<br/>
**VO (NFT/LEIN Vault Oracle)** - Controlled by authorized Risk Team(s), the VO holds admin access to add an NFT/LIEN Vault type on the fly under certain restrictions.
<br/>
**Mom** - Mom is a contract interface to adjust the risk parameters of the Maker Protocol. The chief in DS-Chief has the exclusive authority to call functions through Mom. The following contracts rely on Mom: Spotter, Cat, Vow, Vat, and Jug.
<br/>
**INT-RO (Rates Oracle Interface)** - Interface contract for the Rates Oracle. Accessible by the Rates Oracle. It has bounded authority over the Rates Module.
<br/>
**INT-VO (NFT/Lein Vault Oracle Interface)** - Interface contract for the NFT/LEIN Vault Oracle. It is authorized to add NFT/LEIN Vault types to the system.
